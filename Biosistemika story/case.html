						<p class="company-descr">BioSistemika is a small company, specializing in software development for companies and businesses that work in the BioSciences area. That includes Biotech, Medical Devices, and Pharmaceuticals. Due to its size and specialization, BioSistemika relies on face-to-face meetings and conferences to engage new customers. However, the COVID-19 outbreak made a heavy impact on that lead generation model, raising the need for new channels. In order to do everything right, BioSistemika turned to Slash Studio.</p>

						<section class="reason-to-partner">
							<h2>The reasons that prompted the client to partner with section228 were the following:</h2>
							<ol>
								<li><span>Canceled conferences and F2F meetings.</span> When it comes to such high-value areas as Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, potential buyers want to be 100% confident about the services or products they will be using to improve their performance. This is why conferences, meetings, and trade shows used to be the best way for customers and vendors to get acquainted, speak about pain points and solutions, and build relationships. BioSistemika wasn’t an exception and, therefore, got hit hard by bans and restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
								<li><span>Lack of experience with cold outreach.</span> The client needed a new sales channel for generating leads, engaging prospects, and converting them into buyers. While cold emails were the most convenient option, the client wasn’t familiar with all the stages of email outreach and needed some assistance from email marketing pros.</li>

								<dd>Whenever we have to build a cold outreach process from scratch, we have to make sure that it fits the client and the client’s customers. Therefore, our team and BioSistemika’s team went through a detailed onboarding process, during which both teams exchanged their tasks and duties, shared insights on each other's work and business culture, and provided all the information necessary for preparing email campaigns and market research. This step was essential for gathering feedback on our performance, sending reports, and ensuring that the client gains the highest value from our partnership.</dd>
